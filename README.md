# DeFi Giveaway Smart Contract 🚀

Welcome to the DeFi Giveaway project! This repository contains a Solidity smart contract developed using Hardhat and deployed on the Ethereum blockchain using Alchemy as the provider.

## Contract Address 📬

The smart contract is deployed on Ethereum with the following address:
[0x6DFC54E42cF700d504A4F1D9c65a92d7F1040155](https://etherscan.io/address/0x6DFC54E42cF700d504A4F1D9c65a92d7F1040155)

## Technologies Used 🛠️

- **Solidity**: The smart contract is written in Solidity, the programming language for Ethereum smart contracts.
- **Hardhat**: A development environment and testing network for Ethereum that makes it easy to compile, test, and deploy smart contracts.
- **Alchemy**: Used as the Ethereum provider to deploy and interact with the smart contract.
